# doing:

# done:
- ✔️ add gitlab like console greeting
- ✔️ refactor nerd-mode.js
- ✔️ text selection ==> piping 
	- ✔️ access text from textbox in js
- ❌ map.json
	<!-- having all files in a single .json for easier href redirect updates works in theory but it just add a lot more js and it still is kind of a mess to maintain. the idea is alright. maybe somhting like it already exists. idk. might work on it later if nothing exists. -->
- ✔️ disable right click like from that custom context menu vid
- ✔️ nerd-mode --> .term
